### Task #1: Optimize API Response Time
#### Issue:
The `User#count_hits` method is causing slow API response times.

#### Solution:
##### 1. Optimize Database Query:
The current implementation retrieves all hits for the user since the beginning of the month and then counts them. This can be optimized to use a single SQL query to count hits within the month.

##### 2. Caching:
Implement caching to reduce the number of actual database queries.

Here's the optimized code:

```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :hits

  def count_hits
    start = Time.now.beginning_of_month
    hits.where('created_at >= ?', start).count
  end
end
```

### Task #2: Resolve "Over Quota" Error after Quota Reset
#### Issue:
Users in Australia experience "over quota" errors even after their quota resets at the beginning of the month.

#### Cause:
The `User#count_hits` method uses the server's local time (e.g., UTC) to determine the start of the month, which might not align with the user's local time zone.

#### Solution:
Modify the `count_hits` method to consider the user's time zone when calculating the beginning of the month.

```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :hits

  def count_hits
    start = Time.now.in_time_zone(time_zone).beginning_of_month
    hits.where('created_at >= ?', start).count
  end
end
```

### Task #3: Prevent Users from Exceeding Monthly Limit

#### Issue:
Some users have been able to make API requests over the monthly limit.

#### Cause:
The `user_quota` method in ApplicationController does not consider the monthly quota limit when verifying the user's hit count.

#### Solution:
Modify the `user_quota` method to use a rate limiter that limits the number of requests that a user can make in a given period of time or month.
```

class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  before_filter :user_quota

  def user_quota
    render json: { error: 'over quota' } if current_user.count_hits >= current_user.monthly_quota
  end
end
```

### Task #4: Refactor Code for Better Readability and Maintainability

#### Solution:
Refactor the provided code to improve readability, adhere to coding standards, and promote maintainability. This includes proper indentation, code comments, and meaningful variable/method names.

```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :hits

  def hits_within_current_month
    start_of_month = Time.now.beginning_of_month
    hits.where('created_at >= ?', start_of_month)
  end

  def hits_count_within_current_month
    hits_within_current_month.count
  end

  def monthly_quota
    10_000
  end
end

class ApplicationController < ActionController::API
  before_filter :check_user_quota

  def check_user_quota
    render json: { error: 'over quota' } if current_user.hits_count_within_current_month >= current_user.monthly_quota
  end
end
```

By following the above steps, Acme can improve the performance and quality of their API.
